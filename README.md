# Pancake-chat-app
# UDP Chat Application - group and/or one-to-one communication
# Chat application is similar to MS Teams/Zoom/Vula chat feature.

- First run the server from the terminal

- Then run a client.

- First enter name (to become an active client) in the GUI that will pop up

- Then run more clients, follow the same process of entering names.

- Chat instructions will be displayed in the client terminal - "Type bye to leave" and "Enter message in blank space"

- If a client joins "late" they will receive the message log and will see the messages that were sent before they joined. 

- Typing "Bye" means the client has left the chat and cannot send anymore messages.

- Proceed to close that specific client's terminal
